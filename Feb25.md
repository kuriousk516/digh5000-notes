<h2>Creativity with computers</h2>
<h3>What makes the development platform relevant to DH?</h3>
<p>Nature: is it inherently digital? How important is it to its functioning?</p>
<p>Accessibility: how easy is it for someone to use? Are there entry costs or barriers?<p>
<p>Durability: how long will projects developed on a particular last? Do they have many dependencies?</p>
<p>Ethically: what are the ethical consequences of a specific platform? What is the platform's goal. and can that goal be subverted?</p> 
<h3>Twine</h3>
<p>HTML-based hypertext engine that allows creators to intuitively make interactive texts.</p> 
<p>Can be downloaded locally or used online and has few requirements.</p> 
<p>You don't need to know how to code to make stories, though it can help!</p>
<p>Twine isn't the indie darling it used to be, in many ways it's been supplanted by platforms like Ren'Py and Fungus</p>
<p>Still remains popular amongst queer devs and writers looking for an accessible engine.</p>
