# October 15 - More Coding with Shawn and Some Professional Development

<h2>DH Conference</h2>
<p>There is a calendar on the DH professional development CULearn page where events are posted and we can check out which ones work for our schedules. You give a trip report for the class to report what you've seen. Do several throughout the year - counts towards your grade.</p>
<h2>DH MRE workshop</h2>
<p>Will help you craft a thesis proposal and get a plan to make sure that our projects get through the gateways of our home departments. Meant to help our projects be as successful as possible.</p>
<h2>DHADHO Conference</h2>
<p>Will have use participating in some fashion. Theme this year is "carrefours/intersections."</p>
<p>We should apply for DH conferences and getting rejection isn't a failure - it's a part of learning and and professional development. October 22 is the deadline for the conference this summer. It's a great way to get feedback even if your project isn't finished and it's just speculative. They system for peer revieing is open for this conference (makes it harder to be an asshole, lol). Enables people to be better natured rather than subjecting someone to the potential criticism isn't unnecessarily harsh.</p>
<p>We will be getting together in Mike's Place or something in an informal manner to talk about the program and our disciplines.</p>
