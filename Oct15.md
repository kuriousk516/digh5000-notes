# October 15 - More Coding with Shawn and Some Professional Development

<h2>DH CULearn</h2>
<p>There is a calendar on the DH professional development CULearn page where events are posted and we can check out which ones work for our schedules. You give a trip report for the class to report what you've seen. Do several throughout the year - counts towards your grade.</p>
<h2>DH MRE workshop</h2>
<p>Will help you craft a thesis proposal and get a plan to make sure that our projects get through the gateways of our home departments. Meant to help our projects be as successful as possible.</p>
<h2>DHADHO Conference</h2>
<p>Will have use participating in some fashion. Theme this year is "carrefours/intersections."</p>
<p>We should apply for DH conferences and getting rejection isn't a failure - it's a part of learning and and professional development. October 22 is the deadline for the conference this summer. It's a great way to get feedback even if your project isn't finished and it's just speculative. They system for peer revieing is open for this conference (makes it harder to be an asshole, lol). Enables people to be better natured rather than subjecting someone to the potential criticism isn't unnecessarily harsh.</p>
<p>We will be getting together in Mike's Place or something in an informal manner to talk about the program and our disciplines.</p>
<h2>Coding and Stuff, Guys</h2>
<p>Begins with a ~computer. Paul Ford is situating code into a business context. It's a good approach to take when writing thesis proposals because it uses languages that make coding and digital applications appealing to those who don't understand it. </p>
<p>Susan Hockey applies DH to archaeology and it was one of the first disciplines to really employ it.</p>
<p>Eric Steven Raymond goes over foundation myths for code and where it all began.</p>
<h3>Storytime!</h3>
<p>Source code used to be printed out in magazines (wat), but they would sometimes have typos. Syntax errors would ensue when you tried to "run" the code. You had to have a certain amount of wealth in order to have a computer back then and it was usually dominated by white dudes. Schools started to push to have computers in the classroom - they thought it would enhance student learning. Most students just wanted to play games (lulz). When Columbine happened, the shooters were gamers and the "moral panic" made video games the enemy and an easy scapegoat. This is the main dialogue around the pedological discussions for coding.</p>
<p>Then came a larger push for people to learn coding - it would help you get jobs and make you more hireable. Still tied up with social and political narratives. Digital Humanities was then seen as a Trojan Horse that would diminish the intellectual veracity of what the humaities are meant to be. Code enables individuals to stay connected with others, access data that would otherwise be inaccessible, and have an entire digital world at your disposal.</p>
<p>10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 <- Most famous and iconic bit of code that launched a movement.</p>
<p>We read it left to right (think of the order of operations) -> when we hit 'run", it runs <em>forever</em>. It's gonna print something. Where's it gonna print? A teletite (?) machine in the 70s, and then screens in the 80s. There are fossils within code that enable us to communicate and understand the machine.</p>
<p>CHR = character.</p>
<p>205.5 = a specific location. </p>
<p>RND = round/random (does both at once).</p>
<p>205 looks like this -> \ 206 looks like this -> / Put em together and they repeat, <em>annnnnnnnnnnnddddd</em>:</p>

<p>It creates an infinte maze that we can play around with.</p>
<p>What does coding mean?</p>
<p>It's an act of translation - creating a language that the computer knows how to manipulate. Functions like English in that we read it left to right, there's a mapping between the relationships between the characters and their meanings. Cutting away fluidity is what made the word "computable." The fluidity was too hard to represent, so it wasn't done. Some people didn't see this as a problem and it became an act of forgetting. We lose a lot of the world that way.</p>
<h3>Programming is an act of forgetting.</h3>
<p>There are specific rhetorics as to what tech we should use and going along with the tagline "it just works" (Steve Jobs). That's why DH becomes such a political, radical act where you're <em>not</em> forgetting, you're bringing up what was forgotten before. We're still constrained in that we use the tools that others built. Some are so enmeshed that they can limit what we can accomplish if we're not aware of the use and history to keep in mind.</p>
<p>"Arabic Programming Language as Eyebeam" -> using Arabic to totally change how code is used and what is recognized as a viable digital language. Fibbonaci function - computes a series of number. Conways Game of Life -> initial configuration of a "universe" that repeats itself, and he managed to get that to appear in Arabic. There are language bias in coding that need to be challenged.</p>
<h3>Who Run the World?</h3>
<p>A lot of the early work for computers and coding was done by women. They often had mathematical backgrounds but were still seen as part of the "working class" and therefore not trusted to do the actual computing and information handling. Once computers started taking off and precedence, women were pushed out and men took over their positions because they wanted control over <em>all</em> the processes. Many went and formed their own company but assumed male names so that they would be taken seriously through their correspondance with other companies. There wasn't enough programmers from the male pool of workers, so the British government in the 70s merged their departments in an effort to keep women out still and it ended up irreperably holding them back.</p>
<p>Ada Lovelace (we're getting into some steam punk stuff, ohhhhhh yeeeeaaaaahhhhh). Babbage created machines to aid in calculations for the military and stuff. Machining technology wasn't sophisticated enough to devise the parts needed for the first early, early form of what a computer could be. Ada was a mathematician and figured out a program to make Babbage's machine work. She is regarded as the very first programmer. She couldn't just to it, had to be regulated to a footnote in order to express her ideas (boooo).</p>
<p>Programming is still very much seen as a masculine endeavor. Any time there's projects that involve money, then white men often move in on it. Sexism finds its way back into coding and men take on the "important" and "hard" work while women are regulated to things like "front end" coding and design.</p>
<p>Allen Turring had the initial idea for what a digital computer could be. He was also gay, so in the 50s during the Communist panic, he was put on trial and sentenced to chemical castration. He killed himself a few months afterward. One of the smartest dudes of his generation, but he was still punished and pushed out for being different.</p>
<h3>Algorithms<h3>
<p>A recipe for what you're trying to accomplish. Takes information and presents it in a way that's understandable. An Incan quipos was an early form of encoding - represented information in different ways.</p>
<p>We can understand things that are missing if we have the basics (eg. if y cn rd ths y cn gt a jb). You can lose a lot of information and still get a lot of information across. Information entropy is what became known as a "bit." When you zip files, it throws out information that it doesn't need to reduce its size and then when you unzip it, it pulls information back into the files.
