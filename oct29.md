<h2>Presentation by Yoshi</h2>
<p>Archives are a collection of meterials organized around a similar theme. They most often consist of primary resources, records, and documentation.</P>
<p>Archives are the records that are created and accumulated by an organization or an individual through the course of their activities. The records found in an archival repository are unique and therefore must be manageed and stored to preserve them for current and future use.</p>
Types of Archives:
<ul>
<li>Corporate</li>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Historical Societies</li>
<li>Religious archives</li>
<li>University/College archives/li>
</ul>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p> A database is an organized collection fo structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Most databases use structures quiery language (SQL) for writing and querying data.</p>
<h3>Types of Databases</h3>
<p>There are many different types of databases. The best databases for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Absorbing significant increases in data volume</li>
<li>Ensuring data security</li>
<li>Keeping up with demand</li>
<li>Managing and maintaing the database and infrastructure</li>
<li>Removing limits on scalability maintaining the database and infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Corporate Archives in Carleton University - Experience</h3>
<h3>Preserving Memories of 50,000 Holocaust Survivors and Witnesses</h3>
<p>The USC Shoah Foundation conducted 100,000 hours of testimony from 50,000 individuals. It requires an intense amount of computing power, constant maintainence, and vigilance to make sure nothing is lost.</p>
<p>Access to the files is difficult - making film copies would have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. Making digital copies only takes tens of millions. They use a system called Oracle Storage Tek SL 2800.</p>
<h3>Library and Archives Canada</h3>
<p>Fourth largest library in the world, LaAC is responsible for preserving the documentary heritage of Canada for the benefit of present and future generations; to be a source of enduring knowledge accessible to all.</p>
<h2>Fun Cautionary Tale~</h2>
<p>AKA: "How <b>NOT</b> to make friends; or the day I killed TUP." Objects stood in for things in the TUP (TIber Valley Project). Shawn was entering data as a newly minted student. The database had a form, and it had a bunch of drop-down menus inside of it. He had a stack of forms to enter the information for, but no options on the drop-down menus. So he "opened the hood." He went under and added the options that were missing and cleared his backlogs. But since it had nowhere to cascade through, it fed through and corrupted the existing data. He set the project back by three months (RIP). When you don't know what you're doing, ask for help! Don't experiment on the live project site!</p>
<p>Now, let's practice working on a digital archive.
